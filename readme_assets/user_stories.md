### Personas

- Mansfield State School music teacher: Needing to find new violins for their year 9 music ensemble fairly quickly as two violins went missing at a recent competition.
- Public Trustee: Looking to make a quick sale of physical assets left unclaimed by a person recently deceased.
- "Sam": Graduated from highschool and left home to go to university. Parents contacted him to get rid of his storage items. He is looking to make a sale of his old trumpet to help pay the rent.
- Acacia Ridge School Accountant: Looking to put together a budget report for the school principal as the school is planning for a new big band program
- "Mary": Heard about the initiative through Salvation Army and wanting to see what kinds of instruments are being traded amongst schools. She may or may not have contacts who may have unused instruments in storage.
