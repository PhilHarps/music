<h1>About Us</h1>
<br>
<p>PreLoved is a two-sided marketplace where private owners can list their unused second-hand musical instruments for sale to public and private schools across the Queensland State. 
</p>
<p>The musical component in the Queensland education curriculum is sufficiently mature that the procurement of affordable second-hand instruments will alleviate budget strains and provide more opportunities to students across the board. </p>

<p> This is also an MVP product to demonstrate a fundamental understanding of Ruby on Rails, database schemas in the Coder Academy full-stack web developer bootcamp course of 2019/February. </p>

<p>MVP Components include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Schools can sign up an account to purchase instruments, but not to list instruments for sale. </li>
  <li>Sellers can sign up an account to list their instruments for sale, but they are not allowed to purchase instruments. If they want to buy instruments, go to ebay. </li>
  <li>Stripe transaction </li>
  <li>MVC modelling in the rails framework for CRUD operations with listings, creating roles for authentication/authorisation, cloud storage</li>
  <li>Consolidate learning of CSS, SCSS</li>
</ul> 
<br>

<p><strong>This is an attempt to understand Rails and have an opportunity to hard-code an assignment, rather than simply documentation. </strong></p>
