## Problem Definition

> \*What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project? Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App?\*

Queensland public and private primary and secondary schools have for years enjoyed a robust and comprehensive [musical and arts program](https://education.qld.gov.au/parents-and-carers/activities-music-sports/instrumental-music-program) as part of their baseline education curriculum. More than 400 instrumental teachers and over 50,000 students are currently involved in Education Queensland's [Instrumental Music Program](https://education.qld.gov.au/parents-and-carers/activities-music-sports/instrumental-music-program). Students from grade 3 (age 7-8) to grade 12 (age 17-18) can learn to play band and orchestral instruments in small groups and participate in larger ensembles, such as concert bands and orchestras. For each school to support its own musical curriculum, it is encumbent upon the school's administration to set aside annual budgets to maintain existing inventory (i.e. the purchasing of replacement parts) and to acquire new instruments (i.e. brass, woodwind, percussion, strings) as needed to meet student demands.

Although a [World Class Education -- Musical Instruments Funding Initiative](https://education.qld.gov.au/about-us/budgets-funding-grants/grants/state-schools/core-funding/world-class-education-musical-instruments) is run by the Queensland State Government to divide AUD$1 Million over a three-year period to state schools in major regions, orchestral and band instruments are largely provided on loan to schools. A casual survey of recent market prices revealed that new (student-range) instruments can easily run upwards from $700 (single string instruments) to several thousands (large percussion sets) [(see Music Express)](https://musicexpress.com.au/product-category/band-orchestral/cello/?orderby=price). Public listings such as [Gumtree](https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-musical-instruments/brisbane/c18409l3005721) do provide more affordable price ranges but condition, availability and authenticity are less assured. As migration and fertility rates continue to drive up Queensland's [above-national-average population growth](http://www.population.net.au/population-of-queensland/) since 2007, it is expected that all private and public schools in the state will experience high enrolment student intakes in the coming years.

> \*Why is it a problem that needs solving?\*

**Therefore, for Queensland schools to deliver quality musical education in the face of growing student demands and high market prices, ready access to quality orchestral instruments at affordable rates is paramount.**

This assignment seeks to improve access to quality musical instrument in Queensland schools by building \*\*a walled, two-sided marketplace "Pre:Loved" that allows verified private owners of second-hand musical instruments (i.e. parents of children who may have outgrown their instruments) to sell to primary and high schools at affordable prices.\*\*

> \* Describe the project you will be conducting and how your App will address the needs.\*

- This walled marketplace will shield pricing structure from the general public to service specifically [registered Queensland schools](https://schoolsdirectory.eq.edu.au/).
- Likewise, private seller details will be hidden from the public and only accessed by verified school accounts.
- The marketplace will not serve private individuals but only private sellers and school accounts.
- Only school account holders may purchase intruments on the site.
- Private sellers can only list instruments that abide by the marketplace's stringent grading policy on condition of the instrument.
- These measures will provide quality guarantees to both sellers and schools. Sellers are confident that their instruments will only go to schools in need. Likewise, schools who register on Pre:Loved will be assured that instruments purchased will be in good working order and at sympathetic prices.
