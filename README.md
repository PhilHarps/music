## Problem Definition

_What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?_
\*Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?\*

Queensland public and private primary and secondary schools have for years enjoyed a robust and comprehensive [musical and arts program](https://education.qld.gov.au/parents-and-carers/activities-music-sports/instrumental-music-program) as part of their baseline education curriculum. More than 400 instrumental teachers and over 50,000 students are currently involved in Education Queensland's [Instrumental Music Program](https://education.qld.gov.au/parents-and-carers/activities-music-sports/instrumental-music-program). Students learn band and orchestral instruments in small groups and participate in larger ensembles, such as concert bands and orchestras. For each school to support its musical curriculum and student needs, each school needs to set aside annual budgets to maintain existing inventory (i.e. purchasing replacement parts) and to purchase new instruments (brass, woodwind, percussion, strings) as needed.

Although a [World Class Education -- Musical Instruments Funding Initiative](https://education.qld.gov.au/about-us/budgets-funding-grants/grants/state-schools/core-funding/world-class-education-musical-instruments) is run by the department to divide AUD$1 Million over a three-year period to state schools in major regions, orchestral instruments are largely on loan to schools. A casual survey of market prices reveal that new (student-priced) instruments can easily run upwards from $700 (string instruments) to several thousands (large percussion sets) [(Music Express)](https://musicexpress.com.au/product-category/band-orchestral/cello/?orderby=price). Public listings such as [Gumtree](https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-musical-instruments/brisbane/c18409l3005721) does provide more affordable price ranges but condition and authenticity are less assured. **A school's quality of musical program does depend on the availability of good teachers and quality instruments to loan to students.**

This assignment seeks to respond to the scarcity of instrument availability in Queensland schools by building a walled, two-sided marketplace that allows verified private owners of pre-used musical instruments (i.e. parents of children who may have outgrown their instruments) to pass on an otherwise a good condition instrument to primary and high school students in need.
